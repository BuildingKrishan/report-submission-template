### Specifications

```
As discussed in the meeting, we need to answer the following questions:
```

- [ ] size of machinery / details of the equipment, data sheet details of the parts, working conditions of the machinery
- [ ] Power output
- [ ] Installing cost, running cost, maintenance cost
- [ ] home requirements specifications, what all appliances can be used and for how long

Description
Our goal is to design a Concentrated Solar Thermoelectric system which can be used in the home. It works by concentrating sun's heat using a lens on a Alumimnium Sheet, the hot Aluminum
sheet is connected to a face of TEG and the other face of TEG is connected with a Heat Sink which is at low temperature. Difference in temperature on both sides results in 
Electricity Generation. 

Specifications
    Device Requirements
1.	6 TEG’s tightly fitted below Aluminum Plate
2.	Temp on hot side 200 ° C and Cold Side Temp is 30° C 
3.	Each TEG produces 20W power, Total generated power is 80W (Without battery connection)
4.	A solar concentrator with sunlight area of 1m^2. 
    
    Device Components
1.	TEG Device

    Properties
    
1. Power production deoends on many factors such as sun, sun's direction, water temperature. Power transferred to load depends can't be computed as it depends on several parameters of 
battery system. Generated power in a day assuming 4 hours of good sunlight is = Time of Operation x Energy generated by Each TEG x Number of TEG = 5hr * 20W * 6 = 600 Whr/day = 0.6 Units/day

2. Total Cost = Component Cost + Mounting Cost + Miscellaneous Cost =
